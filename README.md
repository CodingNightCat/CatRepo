# INFO3600 Week 1
- 5 to 6 people in a team
- Meetings at least once per week
- expected workload is 24 hours per week

# This week's tasks
- Fill in survey for project preferences and submit it by 5pm Wednesday 1st August
- Study online about XP and making a summary of what you learn

# Projects
## Subterra.ai
Both hardware and software solutions for sewer inspections
The mission is to develop a cross-platform app that provides a fail-safe method of queuing, background processing and uploading large batches of data to AWS cloud.

- ReactJS, NodeJS, GraphQL, and various serverless and cloud services on AWS.
- UX design, agile project planning and execution, DevOps approaches.

## The Teleporter (bensand.com)
Goal: build a realistic teleportation experience.

### Scene stitching
Use off the shelf VR cameras, place them on a helmet, and use C/C++/Computer vision techniques to stitch together the camera feeds. The goal is high resolution at the front, balanced with a full 3D picture.

### Face stitching 
This one is the hardest. Recommended for INFO3600 students with good math.

Have a camera that points directly to your face.

### Eye tracking Optimizer
Provide a real time resolution optimiser and Project Team 4, to prioritize what we send over the network.
For people interested in hardware integration.

### Networking optimization
Aggregate multiple connections (speedify). For people interested in Linux, firewall, system administration.

### User Interface
Passive 3D technology (3D illustion without 3D glasses, available as laptops (cheaper), another one is for multiple people and very expensive.)
Building the interface in Unity 3D, will require a clever design to combine everything.

## FluroSat
Predictive crop health analytics. Use drones and satilites to gather pictures, and process those pictures to detect dying macadamias and tree varieties.  
False color (replace color that we can't see with a color we can see) can often tell us a lot more than we can see.

looking for people with skills in Github, ReactJS, AWS, Python, TensorFlow (current frontend is in ReactJS).

- frontend
	- feedbacks
	- simple interface for the farmers
	- forecast information
	- web based system
- machine learning

## VetCompass Australia
nation-wide system for collecting data and conducting research.
- collect clinical records of dogs, cat, and horses
- Vet -> Database -> researchers -> Publications -> VetCompass opensource jornals -> back to vet, parents, animals
- We need you to:
	- Identify who needs what data
	- Interesting ways for people to view and manipulate the data
- Experience
	- Data analysis experience
	- SQL and full stack development
	- Visualisation and design thinking

## Data61 - Water Industry Data Analytics Platform
- To provide clean water for residents and industries, analysis on water pipe maintenance is important.
- Machine learning for pipe failure prediction based on learning from historical failure records and attributes related to failure.
- Platform component
	- Data collection
	- Data Processing
	- Data analysis
	- Visualisation
- Uses Python

## TechLab Capstone
### E-BARQ
- Horses are the deadliest animals in Australia
- Toolset to help horse trainers to predict horse behavior before they exist

### Westsartr
- MedStartr for students.
- will have real users engaged with this project.
- Create their own currency

### Beers (Name still unsure)
- Tool to sell beers, a database to help the beer sellers

### The Critical Digital Edition
- Import printed music into digital scores. There are multiple versions of a song that are agreed upon different musicians.
- A tool is needed to sort these things out.

### Game to identify tumor
- Similar to mine sweeper
- Similar to Google's "Let's explore the World!!"

### Help I'm lost at Cumberland
- A clickable interface for the map of the Cumberland campus.

### Skeletor Dog
- Virtual reality skeleton dog
- it has already been done, but it doesn't show the actual analogy and movements of a dog.
- Leap Motion has a prototype for a cat.

## Dashboards for rehabilitations physiotherapy
- Create/use APIs to tools used (e.g. Fitbit)
- Create dashboard prototypes
- Evaluate the prototypes in authentic settings - hospital physios
- Research
- A dashboard creating startup: Springday could collorborate with a team

## Bernhard Scholz
### SkoolBot
- Visual programming environment for 3D-printed robots.
- Provide primary and highschool kids an internet platform
- Technologies:
	- Blockly - open-source interactive visual programming skill
	- C/C++
	- Database

### Tesbed for Bug-Checkers
- Finding null-pointer errors in Java programs
- Industry partner Synopsis Inc.
- Uses **applied graph theory** for memory abstraction.
- Build benchmark suite of existing open-source software
- Extend DOOP with null pointers checks
- Performance evaluation and comparison with Coverty
